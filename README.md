# WolfArchiveChildObservation
I was granted unique permission by Dr. Hill Gates to use the late anthropologist Arthur Wolf's fieldnotes about Taiwanese childhood. 
In this project I used NLP methods to analyze one type of these fieldnotes, the corpus of Child Observation (CO), naturalistic observations of children's social interactions. 
This repository includes one file for LDA topic modeling analysis on the entire CO corpus, and another file for using OpenAI API to analyze a subset of CO. 
I did not include the CO texts or its subset in the repository because these data belong to Arthur Wolf's private archive.
