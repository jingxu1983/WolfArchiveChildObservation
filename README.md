## WolfArchiveChildObservation
# I was granted unique permission by Dr. Hill Gates to use the late anthropologist Arthur Wolf's fieldnotes about Taiwanese childhood. 
# In this project I used NLP methods to analyze one type of these fieldnotes, the corpus of Child Observation (CO), naturalistic observations of children's social interactions. 
# The file "CO_subset_GPT.py" was adapted from the [notebook] (https://github.com/DataScienceTeaching/constellate-RAG-workshop/blob/main/rag_llm_basics.ipynb) created by Grant Glass for the 2024 Text Analysis Pedagogy Institute, free for educational reuse under [Creative Commons CC BY License] (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 
# I did not include the CO texts or its subset in the repository because these data belong to Arthur Wolf's private archive.
